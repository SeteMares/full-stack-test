#  Full-Stack Developer Test
## Brief
Develop a combined backend and frontend application that consumes a 200-article JSON feed, implements simple database search querying, and displays a (at minimum, barebones) website with basic category and search filtering.

## Requirements
We expect to see:

* A Laravel backend application in PHP that consumes the JSON feed, publishes it to a database, and exposes the database via APIs.
* These APIs should expose retrieval of lists of articles, and can perform simple filtering (against categories) and querying (search) of the article main body and title
    * The quality of the search results is not judged
* A database that stores the JSON feed in a well-formed way, with appropriate indexes
* An Vue.JS SPA frontend that calls the backend API, shows the articles and has UX for filtering the category names and a search box
* The design of the frontend is not important and is not judged in this test
* Memory usage should be a consideration
* A full git log showing work done
* A README to explain how to boot and run the end result

What would be nice to have:
* Unit tests
* Migrations
* PHP 8.1 usage


## JSON Feed
A json file (`feed.json`) is bundled with the test.

Although quite verbose, the following fields are of importance (the rest can be ignored or consumed if desired):

* `title` – The title of the article
* `slug` – The unique id of the article
* `content` – This contains the main body of the article. In the provided feed only one array item exists which contains a html body.
* `categories` – Shows the categories associated to the article. primary being the single primary category, and additional being a 0-n list of additional categories. If an article does not have a primary category, use the first additional category.
* `media` – Associated media for the article. The featured type (which may not exist) should appear at the top of the article. If it does not exist, show a placeholder.

# Time Limit
We expect this test to take no longer than 6-8 hours, however there is no hard limit.
